# Module 2 Capstone - Excelsior Venues

Congratulations! Word has gotten out that you know your way around the complexities of the catering and event planning industry, and that you can create amazing software products to help companies make more money in less time. Due to your phenomenal success with the catering system, Excelsior Venues, a company that rents unique space for events, has decided to have your team build a new venue reservation system.

Below are the features and requirements Excelsior Venues is looking for you and your team to complete:

1. As a user of the system, I need the ability to view a list of all of the unique venues in the system, sorted alphabetically by name.
   - A venue includes an id, name, city, state, description, and category. A venue _may have many_ categories.
2. As a user of the system, I need the ability to select a venue that my customer would like to host an event at and see a list of all spaces for the venue.
   - A space includes an id, name, open month, closing month, maximum occupancy, wheelchair accessibility, and a daily rate. 
   - A space may be blocked out for various months during the year. For instance, if the space is outdoors or is generally closed for repairs and maintenance during specific months, this will be represented with the open month and closing month.
   - If an opening and closing month are listed, the venue is open from the first day of the opening month to the last day of the closing month.
   - If the open month and closing month do not have any dates, there are not any availability restrictions based on the month.
3. As a user of the system, I need the ability to select a space and search for availability so I can reserve the space.
   - A reservation search only requires the desired venue, a start date, and an end date.
   - A space is unavailable if any part of their preferred date range overlaps with an existing reservation.
   - If no spaces are available, indicate to the user that there are no available spaces and ask them if they would like to try a different search. If they answer yes, restart the search dialog.
   - The TOP 5 spaces should be displayed along with the cost for the total reservation.
   - BONUS: If a date range is entered that occurs when the space is closed, then the space should not be listed in the available spaces.
   - BONUS: Provide advanced search functionality that allows users to indicate requirements they have based on accessibility needs, a category, and a daily budget.
4. As a user of the system, once I find a space that is available based on my needs, I am able to book a reservation for the space.
    - A space requires the name of the person or group reserving the space, a start date, and an end date.
    - A confirmation id is presented to the user once the reservation has been added to the system.
5. As a user of the system I need to be able to make more reservations until I choose to exit the system from the main menu.
5. BONUS: As a user of the system, I want the ability to search for available spaces across all venues based on my needs so I can make a reservation.
    - Up to 5 spaces for each venue should be displayed if they have availability.
    - The same rules apply as the space search.
6. BONUS: As a user of the system, I would like the ability to see a list of all upcoming reservations within the next 30 days for a selected venue.
